# ascotraceR: A weather driven model to simulate the spread of Ascochyta blight in chickpea over a growing season 

The goal of of _ascotraceR_ is to develop a weather driven model to simulate the spread of Ascochyta blight disease in chickpea over a growing season.     

This model is adapted from a model developed by [(Diggle _et al._ 2002)](https://doi.org/10.1094/PHYTO.2002.92.10.1110) for simulating the spread of anthracnose in a lupin field. The model is run using local weather data, and simulates both host and pathogen related activities.The growth of chickpea is described in terms of development of growing points, and disease progress is measured by quantifying the loss of healthy growing points. As the model runs, it keeps a continuous track of non-infected, latent, infected and sporulating growing points (lesions). The ascotraceRâ€™s minimum input requirements are location specific weather data and a list of input variables.
