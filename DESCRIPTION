Description: A spatiotemporal model that simulates the spread of Ascochyta
    blight in chickpea fields based on location-specific weather conditions.
    This model is adapted from a model developed by Diggle et al. (2002)
   <doi:10.1094/PHYTO.2002.92.10.1110> for simulating the spread of anthracnose
   in a lupin field.
